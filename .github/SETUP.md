# Repository and release setup

## Repository owner

The Cadverix 3D desktop updater publishes releases for `WC3D/Cadverix-3D`.

Keep these values in `apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml`:

```yaml
publish:
  provider: github
  owner: WC3D
  repo: Cadverix-3D
```

The Git remote can use another account or mirror. The `publish.owner` value must match the repository that hosts the release assets.

## GitHub Actions permissions

The `Desktop Release` workflow needs permission to create tags and upload release assets.

Set the repository workflow permission to **Read and write permissions** under:

`Settings` → `Actions` → `General` → `Workflow permissions`

The workflow also declares:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

## Create a release

Push a tag such as `v1.0.6`, or run `Desktop Release` with `workflow_dispatch` and enter `1.0.6`.

The workflow builds these packages:

- Windows NSIS installer
- Linux AppImage
- macOS x64 DMG and ZIP
- macOS arm64 DMG and ZIP

The macOS ZIP files and merged `latest-mac.yml` file are required by `electron-updater`.

## macOS signing and notarization

The macOS job reads these repository secrets:

- `CSC_LINK`: base64-encoded Developer ID Application certificate
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`: certificate password
- `APPLE_API_KEY`: App Store Connect API private key contents or base64-encoded contents
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: App Store Connect API key ID
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: App Store Connect API issuer ID

When all signing and Apple notarization variables are present, the macOS artifacts use their normal names:

```text
Cadverix-3D-VERSION-x64.dmg
Cadverix-3D-VERSION-x64.zip
Cadverix-3D-VERSION-arm64.dmg
Cadverix-3D-VERSION-arm64.zip
```

When one or more signing or Apple notarization variables are missing, the workflow ad-hoc signs the app bundle for integrity and marks the unnotarized packages with the existing `-unsigned` suffix:

```text
Cadverix-3D-VERSION-x64-unsigned.dmg
Cadverix-3D-VERSION-x64-unsigned.zip
Cadverix-3D-VERSION-arm64-unsigned.dmg
Cadverix-3D-VERSION-arm64-unsigned.zip
```

Ad-hoc signed packages can still trigger an unidentified-developer Gatekeeper warning, but their bundle signatures pass strict validation. Add the signing and notarization secrets to remove that warning before public distribution.

Do not commit certificates, private keys, or passwords.
